# Learn_Language-with-Flashcard-GUI-APP 

<h3>Flashcard App built with python modules(tkinkter, random and pandas)</h3>
<h2>The App helps the user learn french words with flascards</h2>
<p>This app displays a flashcard container a french word and in 3 seconds, displays the english translation of the word</p>
<p>If the user did not get the correct english translation of the french word initially displayed, the user should press the "cancel" button</p>
<p>then the user keeps using the app and will later get another try of the missed words</p>
<p>If the user gets the english translation correct, user will not get that particular french word anymore, so the user keep their focus on missed words</p>
